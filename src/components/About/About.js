      <p>
        
     
• Division of labor is essential to economic progress because it allows people to specialize in particular tasks. This specialization makes workers more efficient, which reduces the total cost of producing goods or providing a service.
      </p>
      <p>Specialization of labor: People can barter/offer their services to the community in exchange for other services they’re not great at or don’t enjoy (e.g. a home repair guy offers to fix something for a week’s worth of home cooked meals by a chef or get a programmer to make a simple website)</p>
      <h3>Make community</h3>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. </p>
